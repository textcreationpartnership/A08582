            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>For being in the time of the long vacation 1630, in the Country, at the houſe of the Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend,
<pb facs="tcp:21526:3"/>
and my moſt worthy friend, and Teacher, <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. William Oughtred</hi> (to whoſe inſtruction I owe both my initiation, and whole progreſſe in theſe Sciences.) I vpon occaſion of ſpeech told him of a <hi>Ruler of Numbers, Sines, &amp; I angents,</hi> which one had be ſpoken to be made (ſuch as is vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally called <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Gunters Ruler)</hi> 6 feet long, to be vſed with a payre of beame-compaſſes. <q>He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered that was a poore invention, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance very troubleſome: But, ſaid he, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you are taken with ſuch mechanicall wayes of Inſtruments, I will ſhew you what deuiſes I haue had by mee theſe many yeares.</q> And firſt, hee brought to mee <hi>two Rulers</hi> of that ſort, to be vſed by applying one to the other, without any compaſſes: and after that hee ſhewed mee thoſe <hi>lines</hi> caſt into a <hi>circle or Ring,</hi> with another <hi>moueable circle</hi> vpon it. I ſeeing the great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediteneſſe of both thoſe wayes; but eſpecially, of the latter, wherein it farre excelleth any other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument which hath bin knowne; told him, I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that hee could ſo many yeares conceale ſuch vſefull inuentions, not onely from the world, but from my ſelfe, to whom in other parts and myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Art, be had bin ſo liber all. <q>He anſwered,
<pb facs="tcp:21526:3"/>
That the true way of Art is not by Inſtruments, but by Demonstration: and that it is a prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterous courſe of <hi>vulgar Teachers,</hi> to begin with <hi>Inſtruments,</hi> and not with the Sciences, and ſo in-ſtead of Artiſts, to make their Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers only doers of tricks, and as it were Iuglers: to the deſpite of Art, loſſe of precious time, and betraying of willing and induſtrious wits, vnto ignorance, and idleneſſe. That the vſe of Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is indeed excellent, if a man be an Artiſt: but contemptible, being ſet and oppoſed to Art. And laſtly, that he meant to commend to me, the skill of Inſtruments, but firſt he would haue me well instructed in the Sciences.</q> He alſo ſhewed me many notes, and <hi>Rules</hi> for the vſe of thoſe <hi>circles,</hi> and of his <hi>Horizontall Inſtrument,</hi> (which he had proiected about 30 yeares before) the moſt part written in Latine. All which I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained of him leaue to tranſlate into Engliſh, and make publique, for the vſe, and benefit of ſuch as were ſtudious, &amp; louers of theſe excellent Sciences.</p>
            <p>Which thing while I with mature, and diligent care (as my occaſions would giue me leaue) went about to doe: another to whom the <hi>Author</hi> in a louing confidence diſcouered this intent, vſing
<pb facs="tcp:21526:4"/>
more haſt then good ſpeed, went about to preocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate; of which vntimely birth, and preuenting (if not circumuenting) forwardneſſe, I ſay no more: but aduiſe the ſtudious Reader, onely ſo farre to truſt, as he ſhal be ſure doth agree to truth &amp; Art.</p>
            <p>And thus moſt noble Sir, without any brauing flouriſhes, or needleſſe multiplying of <hi>tautolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gized</hi> and erroneous praecepts, in naked truth, and in the modeſt ſimplicity, of the <hi>Author</hi> himſelfe (whoſe knowne skill in the whole Syſteme of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicall learning, will eaſily free him from the ſuſpicion of hauing the way made for him, and the ſubiect vnuailed, to help his ſight) I haue not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding vnder the protection of your courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous fauour, and learned iudgement, perſiſted in my long conceiued purpoſe, of preſenting this <hi>tractate</hi> to the publique view, and light.

               <p n="1">1 <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are two ſides of this Inſtrument. On the one ſide, as it were in the <hi>plaine of the Horizon,</hi> is delineated the <hi>proiection of the Sphare.</hi> On the other ſide there are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers kindes of Circles, divided after many ſeverall waies;
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:21526:6"/>
together with an <hi>Index</hi> to be opened after the manner of a paire of Compaſſes. And of this ſide we will ſpeake in the firſt place.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The <hi>Firſt,</hi> or outermoſt circle is of <hi>Sines,</hi> from 5 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees 45 minuts almoſt, vntill 90. Every degree till 30 is divided into 12 parts, each part being 5 min: from thence vntill 50 deg: into ſixe parts which are 10 min: a peece<hi>:</hi> from thence vntill 75 degrees into two parts which are 30 minutes a peece. After that vnto 85 deg: they are not divided.</p>
               <p n="3">3 The <hi>Second circle</hi> is of <hi>Tangents,</hi> from 5 degrees 45 min: almoſt, untill 45 degrees. Every degree being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into 12 parts which are 5 min: a peece.</p>
               <p n="4">4 The <hi>Third circle</hi> is of <hi>Tangents,</hi> from 45 degrees untill 84 degrees 15 minutes. Each degree being divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into 12 parts, which are 5 min<hi>:</hi> a peece.</p>
               <p n="5">5 The <hi>Sixt circle</hi> is of <hi>Tangents</hi> from 84 degrees till a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 89 degrees 25 minutes.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Seventh circle</hi> is of <hi>Tangents</hi> from about 35. min: till 6 degrees.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Eight circle</hi> is of <hi>Sines,</hi> from about 35 minutes til 6 degrees.</p>
               <p n="6">6 The <hi>Fourth circle</hi> is of <hi>Vnaequall Numbers,</hi> which are noted with the Figures 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you vnderſtand them to bee ſingle Numbers, or Tenns, or Hundreds, or Thouſands, &amp;c. And every ſpace of the numbers till 5, is divided into 100 parts, but after 5 till 1, into 50 parts.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Fourth circle</hi> alſo ſheweth the <hi>true</hi> or <hi>naturall Sines,</hi> and <hi>Tangents.</hi> For if the <hi>Index</hi> bee applyed to any Sine or Tangent, it will cut the <hi>true Sine</hi> or <hi>Tangent</hi> in the fourth circle. And wee are to knowe that if the <hi>Sine</hi> or <hi>Tangent</hi> be in the <hi>Firſt,</hi> or <hi>Second circle,</hi> the figures of the <hi>Fourth circle</hi> doe ſignifie ſo many thouſands. But if the <hi>Sine</hi> or <hi>Tangent</hi> be in the <hi>Seventh</hi> or <hi>Eight circle,</hi> the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures in the <hi>Fourth circle</hi> ſignifie ſo many hundreds. And
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:21526:6"/>
if the <hi>Tangent</hi> bee in the <hi>Sixt circle,</hi> the figures of the <hi>Fourth circle,</hi> ſignifie ſo many times tenne thouſand, or whole <hi>Radij.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And by this meanes the Sine of 23°, 30′ will bee found 3987: and the Sine of it's complement 9171. And the Tangent of 23°, 30′ will be found 4348: and the Tangent of it's complement, 22998. And the Radius is 10000, that is the figure 1 with foure cyphers, or cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. And hereby you may finde out both the ſumme, and alſo the difference of Sines, and Tangents.</p>
               <p n="7">7 The <hi>Fift circle</hi> is of <hi>Aequall numbers,</hi> which are noted with the figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0; and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſpace is divided into 100 aequall parts.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Fift circle</hi> is ſcarſe of any uſe, but onely that by helpe thereof the given diſtance of numbers may be mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied, or divided, as neede ſhall require.</p>
               <p>As for example, if the ſpace betweene 1<g ref="char:decimalL">⌊</g>00 and 1<g ref="char:decimalL">⌊</g>0833+ bee to bee ſeptupled. Apply the Index vnto 1<g ref="char:decimalL">⌊</g>0833+ in the Fourth circle, and it will cut in the Fift circle 03476+; which multiplyed by 7 makes 24333<hi>:</hi> then againe, apply the Index vnto this number 24333 in the Fift circle, and it will cut in the Fouth circle 1<g ref="char:decimalL">⌊</g>7512+.

               <p>And contrarily, if 1<g ref="char:decimalL">⌊</g>7512 bee to bee divided by 7: Apply the Index vnto 1<g ref="char:decimalL">⌊</g>7568 in the fourth circle, and it will cut in the fit circle 24333: which divided by 7 gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth 03476+. Then againe vnto this Number in the Fift circle apply the Index, and in the Fourth circle it wil cut vpon 1<g ref="char:decimalL">⌊</g>0833+ for the Septupartion ſought for.</p>
               <p>The reaſon of which Operation is, becauſe this <hi>Fift circle</hi> doth ſhew the <hi>Logarithmes</hi> of Numbers. <hi>For if the Index be applyed unto any number in the</hi> Fourth circle, <hi>it will in the</hi> Fift circle <hi>cut vpon the</hi> Logarithme <hi>of the ſame num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, ſo that to the</hi> Logarithme <hi>found you praefixe</hi> a Caracte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſticall

So the Loga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithme of the number 2 will bee found 0.30103. And the Logarithme of the Number 43<g ref="char:decimalL">⌊</g>6 will bee found 1.63949.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Numbers are multiplied by Addition of their</hi> Loga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmes<hi>: and they are Divided by Subſtraction of their</hi> Logarithmes.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Theoreme.</hi> If of three numbers given, the ſecond divide the firſt, and the quotient divide the third; this later quotient ſhall be the fourth proportionall, to the three numbers given.</p>
               <p>Neither is it materiall whether of the two numbers after the firſt be ſecond, or third.</p>
               <p>2 And note that in <hi>Reciprocal proportion,</hi> that terme by which the queſtion is made; But in <hi>Direct proportion</hi> the terme that is <hi>homogeneal</hi> thereto, is the firſt terme, or the Antecedent of the firſt ratio.</p>
               <p>3 And therefore out of theſe foundations thus layd, (if you rightly conceive the nature of the Logarithmes) doth follow <hi>the finding out of the fourth proportionall by this Inſtrument:</hi> whereof this is the Rule.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Open the Armes of the Inſtrument to the diſtance of the firſt, and ſecond number: then bring the Antecedent arme, or that which ſtood vpon the firſt number vnto the third, and ſo the conſequent arme, keeping the ſame opening, will ſhew the fourth number ſought for.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In which operation theſe foure things are diligently to be conſidered.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:21526:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>Firſt, in conſtituting the places of each number in the fourth circle; whether the figures written in the ſpaces doe ſignifie</hi> Vnites, Tenns, <hi>or</hi> Hundreds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, if that arme which ſheweth the fourth proportionall, doe reach beyond the line of the Radius; that then you doe account the fourth in a new circle or degree.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, whether the fourth number ſought, ought to be greater, or leſſer then the third. For if a fourth number bee offered greater then the third, when it ſhould be leſſe, or leſse then the third when it ſhould be greater; it is a ſigne that that number doth appertaine to a circle of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther degree.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly, that looke what true diſtance was betweene the firſt and ſecond, that the ſame bee ſuppoſed betweene the third and the fourth, and alſo on the ſame part.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4 And for becauſe <hi>Multiplication</hi> and <hi>Diviſion,</hi> have a certaine implicite proportion: we will ſpeake of them in the firſt place.</p>
               <p>5 <hi>In Multiplication, As an Vnite is to one of the factores</hi> (or numbers to be multiplied:) <hi>ſo is the other of the factores, to the product.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the product of two numbers ſhall have ſo many places as there be in both the factores, if the leſſer of them
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:21526:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
exceede ſo many of the firſt figures of the product: But if it doe not exceede, it will have one leſſe.</p>
               <p>6 <hi>And in Diviſion, As the Diviſor is to an Vnite; ſo is the Dividend, to the Quotient.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the Quotient ſhall have ſo many places, as the Dividend hath more then the Diviſor, if the Diviſor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede ſo many of the firſt figures of the Dividend: but if it doe not exceede, it ſhall have one place more.</p>
               <p>7 Wherefore let this rule bee ſtill carefully kept in minde: that <hi>In Multiplication the firſt terme of the impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite proportion is evermore</hi> 1<hi>:</hi> And <hi>in Diviſion, the firſt terme is the Diviſor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus much concerning the operation of Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Multiplication, and Diviſion, I thought meete to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh, leaſt hereafter in Multiplying, or Dividing, or ſeeking out a fourth proportional, wee be conſtrained to repeate the ſame things many times over.</p>

               <p>According to the 2 Chap. 3 Sect.

               <p>Therefore 54 · 96 ∷ 9 · 16 · are proportionals. And 16 ſhillings is the price of 9 Elnes.</p>

                  <p>For the two ſolides <hi>AFEHIKLM, BNZYIKLM,</hi> are apparantly equall, againe the two ſolide wedges <hi>GSTPKL, PTVNKL</hi> are equall, and alſo the two ſolide wedges <hi>OCXVLM, VXYZLM</hi> are equall. Now if you turne ouer the wedge <hi>GSTPKL,</hi> vnto the leſſer part <hi>AFEHIKLM,</hi> it will ouer-reach in thickneſſe, at the leſſer end the quantity of <hi>ER,</hi> and if you alſo turne ouer the wedge <hi>OCXVLM,</hi> vnto the leſſer part, you ſhall find it to fill vp the former ouer-reaching, and to make an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act Parallelepipedon, the baſes or ends whereof are equall to the middle Section <hi>IKLM.</hi> but ouer and aboue thoſe two wedges turned ouer, you ſhall haue left the Pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mide <hi>DSVOL,</hi> which was to be proued.</p>
                  <p>And in like manner if a round tapering ſolide, or peece of timber, be meaſured by the middle Section, or circular baſe, I ſay, That the product thereof multiplied by the length, ſhall be leſſe then the true content, by a Cylinder, the diameter of whoſe baſe, is equall to halfe the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the diameters of the two baſes: and the length is one third part of the whole length.</p>

2 Mr. <hi>Edm: Gunter</hi> in his ſecond booke of the Croſſe Staffe, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. pretending to ſhew the manner of gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Wine veſſels, beginneth with theſe words.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>The Veſſels which are heere meaſured, are ſuppoſed to bee</hi> Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, <hi>or reduced into</hi> Cylinders <hi>by taking the meane, betweene the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameter at the head, and the Diameter at the boungue, after the uſuall manner.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And according to this ſuppoſition, teacheth to finde a <hi>Gauge point,</hi> For a gallon of wine, in that his imagined <hi>Cylindriacall veſſell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Becauſe his words are cautelous, and ſubterfugious, wee muſt a little examine them; for if his way bee true, my Rule before ſet downe, though grounded vpon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, cannot ſtand.</p>
               <p>Well then, that reduction of a wine Veſſell into a Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linder, is either true, or falſe; if it bee true what neede thoſe ambiguities of <hi>Veſſels which are here meaſured:</hi> and <hi>are ſuppoſed to be, &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>after the vſuall manner?</hi> if falſe why is it not noted, but deliuered as a Rule to confirme an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror. And what meaneth, <hi>the meane betweene the Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at the head, and the Diameter at the boungue?</hi> is it the <hi>meane Geometricall,</hi> or <hi>Arithmeticall,</hi> that is the <hi>meane pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionall,</hi> or <hi>that which equally differeth</hi> from both? ſuch ſhifting is vnworthy an Artiſt.</p>
               <p>Firſt therefore, Let it be <hi>the meane in reſpect of difference,</hi> which is equall to <hi>halfe the ſumme of the two Diameters:</hi> I ſay that the Veſſell cannot truely be reduced to a <hi>Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> by ſuch <hi>a meane Diameter.</hi> For ſeeing it is moſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent that ſuch a Veſſell, is greater in the middle then at the ends, the boords, or ſides thereof, ſhall from the middle to the ends, goe either ſtreight, and ſo the Veſſel ſhall be as it were, two equall ſegments of Cones, ſet baſe to baſe: Or elſe arching, and ſo the Veſſel ſhall (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſayd, and is commonly taken for a truth) bee a <hi>Sphaeroides,</hi> hauing the two ends equally cut of.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:21526:32"/>
If it be conſidered as two ſegments of Cones: the meaſure by that <hi>meane Diameter,</hi> or midle Section is quite falſe, as hath beene demonſtrated in the former Chapter, Sect: 16, 17. and will be giuen leſſe then the true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, although the ſides goe ſtraight: much more then, if the ſides goe arching; for that conuexneſſe, muſt needs yeeld a greater capacity. And therefore in neither can that manner of Gauging be true.</p>
               <p>Againe, if the <hi>meane Diameter</hi> be vnderſtood to be the <hi>meane proportionall betweene the two Diameters,</hi> it is much more falſe, for betweene any two numbers, the <hi>meane Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ometricall</hi> is leſſe then the <hi>meane Arithmeticall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus much I haue thought good in this place ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to ſignifie to the inexpert Learner, that hee might not beguile himſelfe with a prejudged opinion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I haue ſhewed <hi>the meaſuring of veſſels by the cubic inch:</hi> but our vſuall reckoning is by the <hi>Gallon,</hi> and parts thereof. Wee muſt therefore doe the beſt we can, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the <hi>true quantitie of a Gallon in inch meaſure,</hi> which will bee difficult to doe exactly, both becauſe the <hi>Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dards</hi> vſually are not ſtreight ſided, but a little arching, neither doe they agree perfectly one with another<hi>:</hi> but what partly by experience, both mine owne, and others, which hath come to my ſight; and partly by reaſoning ſhall ſeeme to me moſt probable, I will not refuſe to ſet downe.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Our <hi>Engliſh Gallon</hi> is vnderſtood to bee either in <hi>Ale meaſure,</hi> or <hi>Wine meaſure:</hi> and theſe two meaſures not a little differing. And firſt we will inquire about our <hi>Ale meaſure.</hi>
               </p>

Alſo my worthy friend <hi>Maſter William Twine,</hi> who hath vndergone great paines and charge, in finding out the <hi>true content of our Engliſh meaſures,</hi> gaue vnto me two ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall meaſures of an <hi>Ale-gallon,</hi> and thoſe in due conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration but little differing. The one was found out by a braſſen veſſell made in manner of a Parallelepipedon, the baſe whereof was exactly ſixe inches ſquare, and the ſides diuided into inches and twentieth parts: into which veſſell he powring out a <hi>ſtandard Gallon of Queene Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> filled with water, found it therein to ari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The other was found by taking the dimenſions of that <hi>ſtandard Gallon,</hi> which was made in forme of <hi>a ſegment of a Cone,</hi> but that the ſides were a little arching: the dimenſions were thus; the Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the top was inches 6<g ref="char:decimalL">⌊</g>5: the Diameter of the bottome was inches 5<g ref="char:decimalL">⌊</g>

                  </gap>: and the height of it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches 9<g ref="char:decimalL">⌊</g>8: which being caſt vp by Chap: 8, Sect: 15, will be found to containe cubic inches 268<g ref="char:decimalL">⌊</g>85: differing from the former, only cubic inches 4¾<hi>:</hi> which difference might well ariſe through the curuitie of the ſides. Theſe meaſures he did not only take himſelfe, but to giue me ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, ſhewed me the experience in the ſaid <hi>Veſſell and Standard:</hi> but the truth is, I obſerued the <hi>Standard,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the arching of the ſides, to bee not exactly circular within, nor the brimme of an even height, nor the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome plaine: and in taking the height of the water in the <hi>Veſſell,</hi> our ſight was not able to eſtimate the aſcent thereof ſo preciſely, that a ſpoonefull of water, more or leſſe, could breed any ſenſible difference.</p>
               <p>What therefore ſhall wee doe in this difficultie? in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede looke to the firſt ground, and principle of our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh meaſuring, from Barley cornes. For the length of

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncia,</hi> that is a twelfth part of a foot. 3 feete make a <hi>Yard:</hi> and 16 feet and an halfe, that is 5 yards and an halfe, a <hi>Perch,</hi> with which wee meaſure our land; for 40 perches is a <hi>Furlong,</hi> and 8 furlongs an <hi>Engliſh mile:</hi> and againe 40 ſquare perches is a <hi>Roodland,</hi> 4 roodland make an <hi>Acre.</hi> So then a Perch which is feet 16½, or yards 5½ is as it were the beginning of all land meaſure in length: and a ſquare Perch which is feete 272¼, is as it were the beginning of all land meaſure in the ſuperfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall content.</p>
               <p>Now therefore ſeeing in <hi>Veſſels a gallon is as it were the beginning of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>eſſell meaſure</hi> (for a <hi>Pottell</hi> is but a dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiue of it, and <hi>a quart,</hi> the quarter) it is not vnlikely that our wiſe Anceſtors had ſuch a conſideration alſo in ſolide meaſures, that as a ſquare Perch (the beginning of Superficiall land meaſure) did containe 372 ſquare feete and a quarter; ſo a Gallon (the beginning of veſſell mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure) ſhould containe 272 Cubic inches and a quarter. And the rather ſeeing that the ancient <hi>Geographers,</hi> diuide a foote into 4 <hi>Palmes,</hi> a palme being 3 of our inches, as 3 feete are a yard. So that as the ſide of a ſquare Perch conſiſteth of yards 5½, a Gallon alſo ſhould conſiſt, of a number of Cubic inches the ſquare ſide whereof is palmes 5½.</p>
               <p>Wherefore ſauing the exact truth when it ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, and in the meane time the more probable reaſons of other men, I make bold to tender this my coniecture, to the cenſures of more diligent Inquirers, <hi>That the meaſure of an Engliſh Ale gallon ſhould be a ſquare Veſſell of inch</hi> 16½, <hi>or Palmes</hi> 5½ <hi>every way, and</hi> 1 <hi>inch deepe:</hi> that is 272<g ref="char:decimalL">⌊</g>2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

M. <hi>Henry Briggs</hi> that learned Geometrician, and my very louing friend, made an experiment, with a Cubicall veſſell, which was 12 inches euery way, which hauing filled with water carefully meaſured, found it to containe 7 gallons and an halfe wanting <hi>a moment,</hi> as hee himſelfe long ſince, being then of <hi>Greſham Colledge,</hi> ſignified to me. Now if it had contained exactly 7 gallons, and an halfe, a <hi>wine gallon</hi> ſhould haue beene 230<g ref="char:decimalL">⌊</g>4 cubic inches, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it wanted a little, the gallon muſt be ſomewhat big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, for which <hi>moment</hi> therefore if you will put 6 hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred parts of an inch, the <hi>wine gallon ſhall containe</hi> 231 <hi>cubic inches.</hi>

               <p>Againe M. <hi>Gunter</hi> in the place before mentioned ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that the common opinion is that at <hi>London,</hi> a <hi>Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driacall veſſell,</hi> whoſe diameter is 38 inches, and length 66 inches, doth containe 324 gallons: wherefore by this account a gallon ſhould bee 231 cubic inches almoſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly, which in both ſo neerely agreeing, wee may well conclude, <hi>That an Engliſh wine gallon doth containe</hi> 231 <hi>cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bic inches.</hi>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N euery triangle both Plaine, and Sphaerical, the greater ſide ſubtendeth the greater angle. And the greater angle hath the greater ſide oppoſite vnto it. Alſo the greater angle ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the leſſer ſide, and the greater ſide hath the leſſer angle lying vnto it.</p>
               <p>In euery plaine triangle, any two angles being giuen, the third is alſo giuen: and one of the angles being giuen, the ſumme of both the other two is giuen. For all the three angles together, are equall to two right angles, that is to 180 degrees.</p>
               <p>In a plaine rectangle triangle, one of the acure angles is the complement of the other. Where note that when the complement is named without any other addition, it is meant of the arch, which is wanting of a quadrant of that circle, or 90 degrees. In like manner the exceſſe is meant of the arch, which is aboue a quadrant. But when it is ſaid the complement to a ſemicircle, it is vnderſtood of ſo many degrees as will make vp 180.</p>
               <p>But in a Sphaericall rectangle triangle, one of the oblique angles is alwayes greater then the compl: of the other.</p>
               <p>If two arches together make vp a Semicircle, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of the greater arch, is equall to the complement of the leſſer.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:21526:52"/>
The ſame Right Sine, and the ſame Tangent, and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, doth belong both to the arch it ſelfe, and alſo to the complement of it to a Semicircle. But their verſed Sines differ: For the verſed Sine of an arch leſſe then a qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drant, is equall to the difference of the <hi>Radius,</hi> and the Sine of the complement of that arch: and the verſed Sine of an arch greater then a quadrant, is equall to the ſumme of them. And the verſed Sine is thus found out, As the <hi>Radius</hi> is to the Sine of halfe the arch; ſo is the Sine of that halfe arch, to halfe the verſed Sine of the whole arch.</p>
               <p>In a right angled triangle both Plaine, and Sphaericall, one of the ſides containing the right angles, is called the Baſe, and the other the Cathetus: and the fide ſubtending the right angle is the Hypotenuſa. And know that euery rectangled triangle, is moſt fitly noted with the letters <hi>ABC;</hi> ſo that <hi>BA</hi> may be the Baſe, and <hi>CA</hi> the Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, and <hi>BC</hi> the Hypotenuſa: and <hi>B</hi> the angle at the baſe, and <hi>C</hi> the angle at the Cathetus, and <hi>A</hi> the right angle. Likewiſe euery oblique-angled triangle with the letters <hi>BCD;</hi> ſo that out of the angle <hi>C</hi> a perpendicular <hi>CA,</hi> being let downe, it may in the baſe <hi>BD</hi> diſtinguiſh the two caſes <hi>BA</hi> and <hi>DA,</hi> which are the baſes of the two particular triangles into which it is cut. And in noting the triangles with letters, obſerue diligently, that if any angle be giuen together with one of the ſides including it, the ſame angle be noted with <hi>B;</hi> and the ſide with <hi>BC.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If both the angles at the Baſe <hi>BD</hi> be acute, the perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular <hi>CA</hi> ſhal fall within the triangle: And BD = BA + DA that is <hi>BD</hi> is equall to the ſumme of <hi>BA</hi> and <hi>DA.</hi> And if the angle <hi>B</hi> be obtuſe, the perpendicular <hi>CA</hi> ſhall fall without the triangle, beyond the obtuſe angle <hi>B:</hi> And BD = DA − BA, that is <hi>BD</hi> is equall to the exceſſe of <hi>DA</hi> aboue <hi>BA</hi> or if the angle <hi>B.</hi> be obtuſe, the perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular <hi>CA:</hi> ſhall fall without the triangle beyond the obtuſe

               <p>When any triangle is giuen to be reſolued by Trigono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrie, note the parts thereof (either-ſides or angles) which are giuen and knowne, with a little line drawne croſſe each ſuch part: and note the vnknowne part which is ſought for with a little circle.</p>

                  <p>Seeke the day of the moneth in the annuall circle of the Nocturnall: and apply the Index thereto: marke what houre it cutteth, in the houre circle. Remember this

                  <p>To performe this it is neceſſary that you know the true Meridian of the place wherein you are, and can finde it out by night, which you may thus doe. Hauing a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian line drawne in ſome window, or other conuenient place (as is ſhewed in the Second part of this booke, <hi>Vſe</hi> 19) ſtick vp therein a long needle perpendicularly, and watch till the Sunne caſteth the ſhadow of the needle, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Meridian line. Or elſe in a true Sunne Dyall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue when the ſhadow falls iuſt on 12 a clock, for then is the Sunne in the Meridian. Wherefore goe inſtantly into ſome place about your houſe where you may ſee ſome marke, either a chimney, or the corner of an houſe, or elſe ſome tree, or ſuch like, directly betweene you and the Sunne: then haue you the true Meridian.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="110" facs="tcp:21526:60"/>
Or otherwiſe you may in a cleare night goe into ſome plaine place neere your houſe, and ſetting vp a ſtraight pole perpendicularly on the ground, goe a good diſtance from it Southwards; and then moue vp and downe, till you ſee the top of your pole, directly betweene your eye, and the North polar ſtarre: then ſet vp another pole per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicularly betweene your feet, ſo that both your poles, and the Polar ſtarre, may be in one right line. And then going backe againe to your firſt pole, looke what knowne ſtarre is directly ouer your laſt pole, for that ſtarre is in the Meridian. You may therefore inſtantly goe to ſome conuenient place, and take a marke whereby you may at all times know the Meridian as is afore taught.</p>
                  <p>When therefore at any time of the night you would know what a clocke it is, goe to that place where you ſtood, and looking directly ouer your marke, ſee if any of the 12 fixed ſtarres, bee in the Meridian; or if none of them be therein, obſerue which two of them are on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide thereof, and what part of that ſpace is in the Meridian. Then goe into the light, and take your inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſet the Index to that ſtarre, or point which you ſaw in the Meridian: marke what houre it cutteth, for that ſame houre being added to the houre, which the day of the moneth ſheweth, ſhall giue you the true houre of the night: ſo that you caſt out 12 houres, from the ſaid ſumme, if it ſhall chance to be more.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Example.</hi> Suppoſe the fifth of December, that the middle point of the ſpace betweene the bright ſtarre in the head of <hi>Aries,</hi> and the <hi>Bulls eye,</hi> bee in the Meridian. Set the Index to the middle point of the ſpace betweene thoſe two ſtarres in the Inſtrument: and it will cut in the houre circle 2 and an halfe: then againe ſet the Index to the fifth of December, and in the houre circle it wil cut 7:
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:21526:60"/>
which added vnto 2 and an halfe, giueth 9 and an halfe, for the true houre of the night.</p>
                  <p>Another example. Suppoſe the 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of December, that one third part of the ſpace betweene the <hi>Bulls eye,</hi> and the <hi>right ſhoulder of Orion,</hi> be in the Meridian. Set the Index to one third part of that ſpace in the Inſtrument, and it will cut in the houre circle 4 and halfe a quarter almoſt: againe, ſet the Index to the 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of December, and in the houre circle it will cut 6, which being added vnto 4, and halfe a quarter almoſt, giueth 10 and almoſt halfe a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the houre of the night.</p>

            <p>And becauſe diuers excellent vſes, doe require the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall delineation of the houre circles, I haue in a ſeuerall pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, inſcribed intirely, both the houre lines, and alſo two other circles betweene them, containing euery one fiue degrees.

            <p>For as much as there will be great vſe of this paper In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument; I haue in the 24 Vſe ſhewed the manner of making it: ſo that any that 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The two arches which croſſe the houre lines meeting on both ſides in the points of interſection of the ſixe a clocke lines with the Horizon, are the <hi>two Semicircles of the Ecliptick,</hi> or Annuall circle of the Sunne: the vpper of which arches ſerueth for the <hi>Summer halfe yeare,</hi> and the lower for the <hi>Winter halfe yeare:</hi> and are therefore diuided in 365 dayes: which are alſo diſtinguiſhed into 12 moneths with longer lines, hauing their names ſet downe: and into tenthes, and fifthes with ſhorter lines: and the reſt of the dayes with pricks: as may plainly bee ſeene in the Inſtrument.</p>
            <p>And this is for the ready finding out of the <hi>place of the Sunne</hi> euery day: and alſo for ſhewing of the <hi>Sunnes yearely motion:</hi> becauſe by this motion the Sunne goeth round about the heauens in the compaſſe of a yeare, make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:21526:63"/>
the <hi>foure parts,</hi> or <hi>ſeaſons</hi> thereof. Namely the <hi>Spring,</hi> in that quarter of the Ecliptick which beginneth at the interſection on the Weſt ſide of the Inſtrument, and is therefore called the <hi>Vernall interſection.</hi> Then the <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> in that quarter of the Ecliptick which beginneth with the interſection of the Meridian in the higheſt point next the Zenith. And after that <hi>Autumne</hi> in that quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Ecliptick, which beginneth at the interſection on the Eaſt ſide of the Inſtrument, and is therefore cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Autumnall interſection.</hi> And laſtly, the <hi>Winter</hi> in that quarter of the Ecliptick, which beginneth at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſection with the Meridian, in the loweſt point next the Horizon.</p>
            <p>But beſides this yearely motion, the Sunne hath a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urnall</hi> or <hi>dayly motion,</hi> whereby it maketh day and night with all the diuerſities, and inequalities thereof: which is expreſſed by thoſe other circles drawne croſſe the houre lines: the middlemoſt whereof being groſſer then the reſt, meeting with the Ecliptick in the points of the <hi>Vernall,</hi> and <hi>Autumnall interſections,</hi> is the <hi>Aequinoctiall:</hi> and the reſt on both ſides of it, are called the <hi>Parallels,</hi> or <hi>Diurnall arches of the Sunne:</hi> the two outermoſt where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are the <hi>Tropics,</hi> becauſe in them the Sunne hath his furtheſt <hi>digreſſion,</hi> or <hi>Declination</hi> from the Aequinocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, which is degrees 23½: and thence beginneth againe to returne to the Aequinoctiall. The vpper of the two Tropics next the center (in this our Northerne Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphaere) is the <hi>Tropick of Cancer:</hi> and the Sunne being in it, is higheſt into the North, making the longeſt day of Summer. And the lower next the Horizon, is called the <hi>Tropick of Capricorne;</hi> and the Sunne being in it, is loweſt into the South, making the ſhorteſt day of Winter.</p>
            <p>Betweene the two Tropics, and the Aequinocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all infinite ſuch <hi>parallel circles</hi> are vnderſtoode to bee

contained: for the Sunne is what point ſoeuer of the Ecliptick it is caried, deſcribeth by his lation, a circle pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel to the Aequinoctial. Yet thoſe parallels which are in the Inſtrument, though drawne but to euery ſecond de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Declination, may be ſufficient to direct the eye, in imagining and tracing out, through euery day of the whole yeare in the Ecliptick, a proper circle, which may be the <hi>Diurnall arch of the Sunne</hi> for that day. For vpon the right eſtimation of that imaginary parallel, doth the manifold vſe of this Inſtrument eſpecially rely: becauſe the true place of the Sunne, all that day, is in ſome part, or point of that circle. Wherefore for the better concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, and bearing in minde thereof, euery fift parallel, is herein made a little groſſer then the reſt.</p>
            <p>I Vſe. <hi>And thus by the eye, and view only, to behold and comprehend</hi> the courſe of the Sunne, <hi>both for his</hi> Annuall <hi>and</hi> Diurnall motion, <hi>may be the firſt vſe of this Inſtrument.</hi>

            <p>II Vſe. <hi>To take the</hi> height of the Sun <hi>aboue the Horizon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Set vp the pinne, (which is therefore made fit for the hole at the center) perpendicular in the center: and put the Indices on both ſides, downe vpon the Meridian, that they with their waight, may not ſway the Inſtrument any way as it hangeth: then with a threed put into the hole aboue in the handle, hang it perpendicularly, bearing the edge toward the Sunne, that the pinne may caſt a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, vpon the degrees in the limbe: for that degree which the ſhadow of the pinne cutteth in the limbe, is the height of the Sunne aboue the Horizon, at that preſent.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Looke the day of the moneth propoſed in the Eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic, and marke how many degrees the prick ſhewing that day, is diſtant from the Equinoctiall, either on the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, or Winter ſide, <hi>viz</hi> North, or South.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Example. I.</hi> What will the Declination of the Sunne be, vpon the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of <hi>Auguſt?</hi> Looke the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of <hi>Auguſt:</hi> and you ſhall find it in the ſixt Circle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the Aequinoctiall: now becauſe each Parallel, ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth (as hath beene ſaid before) for 2 degrees, the Sunne ſhall that day decline North-wards 12 degrees.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Example.

            </p>
            <p>Seeke out (as was laſt ſhewed) the imaginary Circle or Parallel of the Sunnes courſe, for that day, and marke the point where it meeteth with the Horizon, both on the Eaſt and Weſt ſides thereof, for that is the very point of the Sunnes riſing, and ſetting that ſame day, and the hower lines which are on both ſides of it, by proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the diſtance reaſonably, according to 15 minuts, for the quarter of the hower, will ſhew the hower of the Sunnes riſing, on the Eaſt ſide, and the Sunnes ſetting on the Weſt ſide.</p>

            </p>
            <p>When the Sunne is in the Aequinoctiall, it riſeth, and ſetteth at 6 a Clock, for in the inſtrument, the interſecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Aequinoctiall, and the Ecliptic with the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon, is in the 6 a clock Circle on both ſides. But if the Sunne bee out of the Aequinoctiall, declining toward the North, the interſections of the Parallel of the Sunne with the Horizon, is before 6 in the Morning, and after 6 in the Euening: and the diurnall Arch of the Sunne, greater then 12 howers; and ſo much more great, the greater the Northerne Declination is. Againe if the Sun be declining toward the South, the interſections of the Parallel of the Sunne with the Horizon, is after 6 in the Morning, and before 6 in the Euening; and the diurnall Arch leſſer then 12 howers; and by ſo much leſſer, the greater the Southerne Declination is.</p>
            <p>And in thoſe places of the Ecliptic in which the Sun moſt ſpeedily changeth his Declination, the length alſo of the day is moſt altered, and where the Ecliptic goeth moſt parallel to the Aequinoctiall changing the Declina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but little, the length of the day alſo is but little altered.</p>
            <p>As for example, when the Sunne is neere vnto the Aequinoctiall, on both ſides, the dayes increaſe, and alſo decreaſe ſuddenly and apace: becauſe in thoſe places, the Ecliptic inclineth to the Aequinoctiall in a manner like a ſtreight line, making ſenſible declination. Againe when the Sunne is neere his greateſt Declination, as in the height of the Summer, and the depth of Winter, the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:21526:66"/>
dayes keepe for a good time, as it were at one ſtay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in thoſe places the Ecliptic is in a manner parallel to the Aequinoctiall, ſcarce altering the declination: and becauſe in thoſe two times of the yeare, the Sunne ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth as it were ſtill, at one declination; they are called the <hi>Summer Solſtice,</hi> and the <hi>Winter Solſtice.</hi> And in the meane ſpaces, the neerer every place is to the Aequinocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, the greater is the diverſitie of dayes.</p>
            <p>Wherefore we may hereby plainely ſee, that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon receiued opinion, that in every moneth, the dayes doe equally increaſe, is erroneous.</p>
            <p>Alſo wee may ſee that in Parallels equally diſtant from the Aequinoctiall, the day on the one ſide, is equall to the night on the other ſide.</p>

And on the board taking the interſection of the ſhadow line with the perpendicular for the Center, deſcribe a Circle equall to the innermoſt Circle of the Limbe: (which you may eaſily doe, if you ſet one foot of your compaſſes vpon the Eaſt, or Weſt point, and extend the other foot vnto 60 degrees, on the ſame innermoſt Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, for this diſtance is equall to the <hi>Radius</hi> thereof.)

            <p>Vpon halfe a ſheet of ſtrong large Dutch paper, (the larger, the better) draw two ſtreight lines, making a right Angle neere one of the corners, the one through the length, and the other through the breadth of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; which two lines I therefore call the longer, and the ſhorter perpendicular.</p>
            <p>Vpon the right Angle point, being the Center, with a Semidiameter equall to that by which you intend to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineate your inſtrument, deſcribe a quadrant of a Circle: and on the point where it meeteth with the ſhorter per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular, draw a long tangent line parallel to the longer pependicular.</p>
            <p>Divide the Quadrant into 90 degrees, among which from the beginning at the ſhorter perpendicular, reckon the eleuation of the Pole, for which you will make your
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:21526:70"/>
inſtrument, and applying a Ruler to the end thereof, and to the Center, where the Ruler cutteth the tangent line make a prick.

            <p>Then out of the Center vnto the ſecond parallel through every degree of the quadrant, draw fine ſtreight lines, cutting alſo the firſt Parallel.

Alſo reckon the complement of the height of the Pole, vpon the ſcale of Centers of Arches, and with your compaſſes take the diſtance from the end ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to the Center: the ſame ſhall bee the Semidiameter of the Aequinoctiall, to bee drawne from the Eaſt point of the Horizon through the point of interſection with the Meridian vnto the Weſt point.</p>
            <p>Againe take with your compaſſes vpon the ſcale of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees in your paper the complement of the height of the Pole: and ſet it vpon the Meridian on the other ſide of the Center from the Aequinoctiall: there ſhall bee the Pole of the Aequinoctiall, or of the World, in which all the houre lines ſhall croſſe one another.</p>

For as much as in delineating the horary Circles, which are within 30 degrees of the Meridian, the Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diameters will be too long for your compaſſes: you may in that ſtreight thus helpe your ſelfe.

            </p>
            <p>Reckon this diſtance on the limbe of your Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from both ends of the Meridian, and marke it. Thus doe for the 25<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, and 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> horary Circle on both ſides of each end of the Meridian.</p>

Divide each halfe of the Diameter into 3 equall parts, with 4 points, and from every of thoſe points vnto the Arch draw lines parallel to the firſt long line.

            <p>XXV. Vſe. <hi>To ſet</hi> an vpright Wall <hi>or</hi> plaine vpon the inſtrument: <hi>and to find</hi> how many houres the Sunne ſhall ſhine thereon at ſome time of the yeare.</p>
            <p>The ſituation of Wals, or Plaines is conſidered either in reſpect of the Meridian, or of the Horizon. And vnto both it is either perpendicular, or oblique, or parallel.</p>
            <p>The plaine perpendicular to the Meridian, is that which ſtandeth directly North, or South: which if it be alſo perpendicular to the Horizon, is called North, or South direct vpright. But if it ſtoope from the Zenith forward, it is called North, or South inclining: if backe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:21526:74"/>
it is called North or South reclining. And note that in a ſtooping Plaine that ſide which is toward the Horizon, is inclining, and that which is toward the Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nith is reclining.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Plaine oblique to the Meridian</hi> is that which ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not directly North, or South, but declineth one ſide into the Eaſt, and the other into the Weſt: and is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called <hi>Declining Eaſtward, or Weſtward,</hi> according as either ſide of the Plaine looketh: As if an vpright Wall being Southerne, declineth from the South into the Eaſt, it is called <hi>South declining Eaſtwards vpright.</hi> But if it be not vpright, it is called <hi>South declining Eaſtward,</hi> and <hi>inclining, or reclining.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Plaine parallel to the Meridian,</hi> is that which loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth directly Eaſt, or Weſt; and accordingly, hath his denomination, whether it bee <hi>Vpright, Inclining, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Plaine Parallel to the Horizon,</hi> is called Horizontall: and is repreſented by the inſtrument it ſelfe, or at leaſt by the inner moſt Circle of the limbe thereof.</p>
            <p>And note that the Arch of Declination, is reckoned from the next Eaſt, or Weſt point. And that the Arch of Inclination, or Reclination is reckoned from the Zenith, or the complement of it from the Horizon. So that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vpright Plaine is vnderſtood to paſſe through the Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nith, which in the inſtrument is the Center.</p>
            <p>And thus having ſhewed the ſeuerall affections of Plaines, wee will now proceed to ſhew the manner how to ſet them vpon the Inſtrument.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A Direct North, or South vpright Plaine,</hi> is repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the inſtrument by a line drawne through the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from the Eaſt point to the Weſt, which is alſo the Horizontall interſection of the Pla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ne. And by it you
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:21526:75"/>
ſhall ſee that the Southerne ſide or face of the plaine is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to all the houres betweene ſixe in the morning and ſixe in the evening. And that about <hi>London,</hi> the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne ſide, onely in the Summer enioyeth the Sunne from his riſing till after ſeven in the morning: and from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 5 a clocke in the afternoone, till his ſetting.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A direct Eaſt, or Weſt upright plaine,</hi> is repreſented in the Inſtrument by the Meridian, which is alſo the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zontall interſection of the plaine. And in it you ſhall ſee that all the forenoone houres are open to the Eaſt ſide: and all the afternoone houres to the Weſt ſide.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A Declining Plaine</hi> is thus ſet upon the Inſtrument, reckon on the Horizon the arch of Declination, from the Eaſt, or Weſt point: and at the end draw a line through the Center vnto the oppoſite point of the Horizon: So that each ſide thereof may be open to that point, either Eaſt, or Weſt, into which the Declination is ſuppoſed. That line ſo drawne throught the center is the Horizon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall interſection of the plaine, and repreſenteth the plaine it ſelfe, if it bee vpright. For example, there is about <hi>London</hi> an vpright Wall declining Eaſtwards 35 degrees: which I would ſet vpon the Inſtrument. Hold the Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne part of the Inſtrument to you, and reckon from the Eaſt backward into the North vpon the Horizon 35 degrees: there draw a line through the Center: this line ſhall not onely vpon the South ſide repreſent a Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne Plaine declining Eaſtward 35 degrees. But alſo vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the North ſide ſhall repreſent a Northerne Plaine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining Weſtward 35 deg. And moreover it will appeare that on the Southerne ſide ſhall bee drawne the houres from almoſt 4 a clocke in the morning, till 3 in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone. And that in the Northerne ſide ſhall bee drawne vpon one ſide 4 a clocke in the morning onely: and vpon the other ſide all the houres from 3 in the afternoone till Sunne ſet.</p>

As in the former example, There is about <hi>London</hi> a Northerne wall declining Weſtward 35 deg. I would know at what time of the day the Sunne will begin to ſhine vpon it on the 24<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of <hi>March.</hi> Set the Index at 35 deg: from Weſt toward South: and becauſe that day the Sunnes Declination is 6 degrees Northward; Looke at what houre the ſixt Parallel aboue the Aequinoctiall toward the Center meeteth with the Index ſo placed: and you ſhall find it at 3 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Poles of every vpright Wall are in the Horizon 90 deg: that is a quarter of a Circle, diſtant from the line repreſenting the Plaine. Wherefore if vpon that line in the Center you erect a perpendicular, the ends ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in the Horizon ſhall be the poles of that Plaine: and are ſo farre diſtant from the North and South points, as the Plaine it ſelfe is from the Eaſt, and Weſt.</p>

            </p>
            <p>When you haue <hi>an Inclining,</hi> or <hi>Reclining Plaine</hi> to be deſcribed on the Inſtrument.

            <p>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:21526:76"/>
Then vpon the ſcale of degrees in your paper, reckon the arch of Inclination, or Reclination; and with your compaſſes take, &amp; ſet it in your Inſtrument vpon the line perpendicular to the Horizontall interſection of your Plaine, from the Center that way into which the Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Reclination tendeth: the ſame ſhall bee the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt point of your Plaine.</p>
            <p>Againe, with your Compaſſes take the Complement of inclination, or reclination, both upon the ſcale of degrees, and alſo upon the ſcale of centers of arches in your pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: and ſet both ſpaces upon the ſame perpendicular line, but on the other ſide of the center (extended if need be): At the ſhorter of thoſe ſpaces ſhal be the pole of your plaine: and at the longer of them ſhal be the Center of it.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, ſetting one foot of your Compaſſes in the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of your Plaine, and extending the other foot to the vppermoſt point, deſcribe in your Inſtrument an Arch of a Circle: which if you haue done well, will exactly fall vpon the ends of the Horizontal interſection of your Plaine. That Arch ſhall repreſent your Plaine, inclining vpon the lower ſide, which is toward the Horizon, or Limbe: but reclining vpon the vpper-ſide, which is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Zenith, or Center. And ſo either ſide ſhall ſhew in what hower lines the Sunne, at ſome time of the yeare, will ſhine vpon it: that in delineating a Dyall thereon, it may not be combered with vnneceſſary houre lines. For Example, ſuppoſe that the former Plaine, which with the South declined Eaſtward 35 deg: doe alſo incline 41 deg: 30 min. Wherefore alſo with the North ſide it ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline Weſtward 35 deg<hi>:</hi> and Recline 41 deg: 30 min. Deſcribe this plaine vpon your Inſtrument with an Arch of a Circle, found out as was taught laſt before. And it will appeare that vpon the Inclining ſide ſhall be drawne all the houre lines from almoſt 4 in the morning, to 4 in the afternoone: And vpon the Reclining ſide ſhall bee drawne firſt 4 and 5 in the morning: and then beginning at 0 a clocke, all houres to Sunne ſet.</p>

And note that in all Northerne plaines, the North Pole is eleuated: and in all Southerne plaines the South Pole is eleuated. Except ſuch North inclining, and South reclining Plaines, that in the Inſtrument fall below the North Pole, betweene it and the Horizon: For in them the contrary Pole is eleuated. And alſo that a direct Eaſt and Weſt plaine, if it Recline, hath the North Pole ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uated: and if it Incline, the South Pole.</p>
            <p>XXVII. Vſe. <hi>The Plaine being ſet vpon the Inſtrument, to find the</hi> diſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the houre lines, <hi>and</hi> Subſtile from the Horizontall Interſection. <hi>And alſo the</hi> height of the Stile aboue the Subſtile.</p>
            <p>Euery Dyall either hath a Center in which all the houre lines, together with the Subſtile, and Stile doe meet: or elſe it hath no center, &amp; ſo they are al parallel one to another.</p>
            <p>If the Plaine being ſet vpon the Inſtrument, cutteth the Pole of the Aequinoctiall (that is the point in which all the horary Circles croſſe the Meridian) the Dyal to be drawne vpon that Plaine ſhall haue no Center. But if it cutteth not the Pole, the Dyal ſhall haue a Center. And of theſe Dyals with Centers wee will firſt intreate: as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſt proper for the vſe of the Inſtrument.</p>
            <p>Behold therefore the Pole of your plaine heedily what horary Circle it falleth vpon: Or if it fall betweene any two, the diſtance of each being reaſonably apportioned, imagine a horary Circle paſſing through it. Marke in what point that horary Circle, either real, or imagined, doth cut the Plaine, that ſame point ſhall bee the place of the Subſtile in your Plaine: and the height of the Stile aboue it, is the Arch of that horary Circle intercepted betwixt the Pole of the Aequinoctial, and the point of the Subſtile noted in the Plaine.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:21526:77"/>
Therefore applying a Ruler to the Pole of your Plaine, carry it about vnto all the interſections of the Plaine with the houre Circles, and the ſubſtile ſeuerally: and where in euery place the Ruler ſhall cut the innermoſt Circle of the Limbe, there make a viſible marke: For the arches of the Limbe intercepted betweene the Horizon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall points of your Plaine, and euery one of thoſe marks, ſhall be the diſtance intended to be ſought.</p>
            <p>But for the Horizontall plaine, the ends of the houre Circles in the Limbe of your inſtrument, doe giue the diſtance without any more adoe.</p>
            <p>Concerning the height of the Stile aboue the Subſtile: It is apparent by the inſtrument, that in a Horizontal dyal, the 6 a clocke line lyeth directly Eaſt and Weſt: and the Meridian perpendicular to it, directly North and South. And that the Meridian is the Subſtile. And that the height of the Stile aboue the Subſtile, is equall to the height of the Pole in that place.</p>
            <p>It is alſo apparent, that in all direct North and South Dyals, the 6 a clocke Line is drawne parallel to the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon, and the Meridian perpendicular to it: And that the Meridian is the ſubſtile. And that the height of the Stile aboue the ſubſtile, if the Plaine bee vpright, is equall to the complement of the height of the Pole. But if it be North inclining, or South Reclining, it is equall to the difference, of the height of the Pole, and the Arch of Inclination, or Reclination. And if the Plaine bee North Reclining, or South Inclining, it is equall to the Summe of the complement of the height of the Pole and of the Arch of Inclination, or Reclination. And if the Plaine fall vpon the Aequinoctiall, the ſtile ſhall ſtand vp perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular vpon it in the Center: and the hower lines ſhall be drawne all at equall Angles, <hi>viz.</hi> 15 degrees one from another.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:21526:77"/>
In ſuch Dyals as haue not the Meridian for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile, the height of the Stile aboue the Subſtile is thus ſound by the Inſtrument. It was ſhewed before that the height of the ſtile aboue the ſubſtile is the Arch of the horary Circle through the Pole of the Plaine, intercepted betweene the pole of the Aequinoctiall, and the point noted in the Plaine for the ſubſtile. Therefore from the Horizontall points, or interſections of that horary Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle reckon 90 degrees both wayes: and thereto through the Center draw an obſcure line: in which line ſhall be both the Inclination of that horary Circle, which is the diſtance of the interſection, or vppermoſt point thereof from the Center: and alſo the Pole. Then with your compaſſes take that diſtance, or Inclination: and ſetting it vpon the ſcale of degrees in your paper, ſee how many degrees it containeth vpon that ſcal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. Againe vpon the ſame ſcale take with your compaſſes the complement of that inclination or diſtance, which being ſet vpon the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure line on the other ſide of the Center, ſhall ſhew the Pole of that horary Circle. Laſtly applying a Ruler to the Pole of that horary Circle, and both to the Pole of the Aequinoctiall, and to the point of the ſubſtile in the Plaine ſeuerally: marke where in both places the Ruler cutteth the innermoſt limbe of your inſtrument: For the degrees of the limbe intercepted betwixt thoſe markes, ſhall be the height of the ſtile, aboue the ſubſtile, which was ſought for.</p>
            <p>And by this which hath beene taught you ſhall find that in an vpright Dyall declining, as before 35 deg: from the South into the Eaſt, or from the North into the Weſt, the ſubſtile ſhall fall vpon that horary Circle, which is about 3 deg: after 9 a clock in the morning: and the ſtile eleuated aboue the ſubſtile about 31 deg: And alſo that in a South Dyall declining Eaſtward 35 deg: and inclining 41 deg: 30 min: Or in a North declining Weſtward 35 deg: and reclining 41 deg: 30 min: the

ſubſtile ſhall fall vpon that horary Circle which is about 8 degrees after 6 a clock<hi>:</hi> and the ſtile eleuated aboue the ſubſtile about 63 deg. 30 minutes.</p>
            <p>XXVIII. Vſe. <hi>The making of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of plaine</hi> Dyals with Centers.</p>
            <p>I haue already ſhewed how to find out in our Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the diſtances of all the houre lines, and the ſubſtile, from the Horizontal interſection. Now the delineating of a Dyal is nothing elſe but to transferre thoſe diſtances out of your Inſtrument into the Dyal plaine, euery one in his due ſituation: and then through them, out of the Center, to draw ſuch houre lines as ſhall be of vſe, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the ſubſtile.</p>
            <p>The due ſituation of thoſe diſtances vpon the Dyal plaine, dependeth on the true placing of the Meridian, or 12 a clocke line: for that being truely deſcribed, all the reſt will be eaſie enough.</p>
            <p>Firſt therefore I will ſhew the manner how the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, or 12 a clocke line, is to be deſcribed.</p>
            <p>Take in your Dyal ſome point for the Center, where you ſhall thinke fit: and through it draw a line parallel to the plaine of the Horizon. Croſſe it in the Center with a perpendicular line. And hauing opened your compaſſes to the length of the Semidiameter of your paper Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, deſcribe on the Center a Circle equall to the inner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Limbe thereof. In which Circle the line parallel to the Horizon is for the Horizontal interſection: and the other for the line perpendicular to it: and the Circle it ſelfe repreſenteth the plaine: Marke therein the Eaſt and Weſt ſides of the Plaine with <hi>E</hi> and <hi>W.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Horizontal, and in al North and South direct Plaines, both vpright, and ſtooping; and in all vpright
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:21526:78" rendition="simple:additions"/>
declining plaines, the Meridian is perpendicular to the Line parallel to the Horizon.</p>
            <p>In North <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>clining, and South reclining plaines, the Meridian is to bee drawne on that ſide of the Dyal plaine either Eaſt, or Weſt, into which the declination is: But in North inclining and South reclining, on the contrary ſide. And if the plaine bee Northerne, the Meridian ſhall be aboue the Line parallel to the Horizon: and if the plaine be Southerne, it ſhal be vnder it. And if the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Pole be eleuated, it ſhall be drawne through the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the oppoſite Quadrant of the Circle in your Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al plaine.</p>
            <p>Laſtly in a direct Eaſt and Weſt plaine, both inclining and reclining, the Meridian is the ſame with the line pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel to the Horizon.</p>
            <p>Wherefore with your compaſſes take the diſtance in the limbe of your Inſtrument, from the next Horizontall point, vnto the marke of the Meridian; and meaſure it vpon the Circle of the Dyal plaine, in that part, and on that ſide, according as in conſideration of the eleuated Pole, and of the qualitie of the Plaine, was ſhewed to be agreeable. And at the end of that arch, through the Center, draw a line for the Meridian.</p>
            <p>Againe with your compaſſes take the diſtances in the limbe of your Inſtrument, betweene the marke of the Meridian, and the markes of all the houre Lines ſeuerally: and ſetting them vpon the Circle of the Dyal plaine or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly from the Meridian, the Forenoone houres on the Weſt ſide of it, and the Afternoone houres on the Eaſt ſide: at the end of euery one of thoſe arches draw the houre Lines: and diſtinguiſh them with their proper fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures accordingly.</p>
            <p>Laſtly faſten the ſtile in the Center, ſo that it may hang perpendicular vnto the plaine in the Subſtile, at the iuſt height. And becauſe the ſtile in every Dyal is vnderſtood to be a ſegment of the Axis of the world
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:21526:79"/>
which is a line imagined to paſſe from the North to the South Pole through the Center of the earth; the ſtile being rightly placed ſhal ſtill with the end point towards the eleuated Pole, that is vpward from the Center, if the North Pole be eleuated; or downeward from the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter if the South Pole be eleuated.</p>
            <p>XXIX. Vſe. <hi>The making of all manner of plaine</hi> Dyals not hauing Centers.</p>
            <p>If the plaine repreſented on the Inſtrument (as was taught before in the XXV and XXVI Vſes) cut the Pole of the Aequinoctiall, it is an horary Circle, either one of them which are drawne in the Inſtrument, or falling be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene ſome two of them: and the Dyall plaine it ſelfe ſhall not croſſe the axis of the world, but lye parallel to it, without any Angle of eleuation. And therefore ſuch a Dyal can haue no Center: But the ſtile, the ſubſtile, and all the houre lines ſhall be parallel one to another.</p>
            <p>Every ſuch Plaine repreſented on the Inſtrument,</p>
            <p>Either, <hi>Firſt</hi> it is the Meridian of the place, the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zontall interſection whereof is the 12 a clocke Line drawne from North to South: and the Dyall made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is a direct Eaſt, or Weſt vpright Dyal: In which the ſubſtile is diſtant from the Line, in the Circle of the Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all plaine parallel to the Horizon, with an Arch equall to the eleuation of the Pole, and vpward toward the Pole. And is alſo the 6 a clocke line in your Dyal.</p>
            <p>The reſt of the houre lines are thus deſcribed. Draw through the ſubſtile, in any point, a long Line at right Angles: that line ſhall bee the Aequinoctial interſection vſually called the <hi>Contingent line:</hi> And taking a conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent diſtance for the ſtile to hang parallel over the ſubſtile (according to the greatneſſe of your Dyall plaine)
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:21526:79"/>
meaſure it vpon the ſubſtile from the Aequinoctiall inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſection: and vpon the end of that meaſure, deſcribe halfe a Circle for the Aequinoctiall it ſelfe. Diuide each Quadrant thereof from the ſubſtile, into 6 equall parts, or houres. Then applying a Ruler to the Center, and to euery one of thoſe diuiſions ſeuerally, where in euery place the Ruler ſhall cut the long line of Aequinoctiall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſection, make pricks: and through thoſe pricks draw the houre lines, parallel to the Subſtile, or 6 a clocke line: diſtinguiſhing ſo many of them as bee needfull, with their figures: that is all the Forenoone houres on the Eaſt plaine, and all the Afternoone houres on the Weſt plaine. But in theſe Dyals there is no 12 a clock line, it being infinitly diſtant from the Subſtile. Laſtly hang the ſtile directly over the Subſtile, and parallel to it, at the diſtance formerly taken. And thus are your Eaſt, and Weſt Dyals finiſhed.</p>
            <p>Or <hi>Secondly,</hi> it is the ſixt houre Circle, the Horizon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal interſection whereof is the line of Eaſt, and Weſt: and the Dyal made thereon is direct North inclining, or South reclining, with an Arch equal to the complement of the height of the Pole. And the parallel to the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon is the Aequinoctial interſection: and the line perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular to it is the 12 a clocke line, and alſo the Subſtile.</p>
            <p>The reſt of the houre Lines, from 7 a clocke in the morning, to 5 in the euening, are thus deſcribed. Take a conuenient diſtance for the Stile from the Subſtile, meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it vpon the Subſtile from the Aequinoctial inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſection: and on the end of that ſpace deſcribe the Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circle of the Aequinoctial, to bee diuided on both ſides of the Subſtile into 6 houres: through euery one of which out of the Center, a Ruler being applyed; at the points of the ſeuerall interſections of the Ruler with the Aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial interſection, draw the houre Lines parallel to the Subſtile, or 12 a clocke Line: diſtinguiſhing them with their figures, namely 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, on the Weſt ſide:
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:21526:80"/>
and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, on the Eaſt ſide: but in theſe Dyals there is no ſixe a clocke Line, it being infinitly diſtant from the Subſtile. Laſtly hang the Stile directly over the Subſtile, and parallel to it, at the diſtance formerly taken.</p>
            <p>Or <hi>Thirdly,</hi> it is North inclining, or South recli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and alſo declining: in which.</p>
            <p>As the tangent of the <hi>Eleuation of the Pole,</hi> is to the <hi>Radius;</hi> So is the Sine of the compl: of <hi>Declination,</hi> to the tang: of the compl: of <hi>Inclination</hi> or <hi>Reclination.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Plaine being ſet vpon the Inſtrument by the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Declination and ſtooping thereof (as hath beene taught in XXV <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Vſe) ſhall cut the pole of the Aequinocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. Apply therefore a Ruler to the Pole of the plaine, and to the Pole of the Aequinoctial; and the point in which it cutteth the Limbe, marke for the ſubſtile: which is to bee transferred vnto the Circle of the Dyal plaine, by taking the diſtance betweene that point, and the next Horizontal interſection, and ſetting it on that Circle from the line parallel to the Horizon, vpward if the plaine be North: or downe-ward if the plaine bee South: and on that ſide which is contrary to the Declina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The ſubſtile being thus ſound, draw a long line per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular to it, for the Aequinoctial interſection. And ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a conuenient diſtance for the ſtile from the ſubſtile, meaſure it vpon the ſubſtile from the Aequinoctiall interſection<hi>:</hi> and on the end of that ſpace deſcribe the Semicircle of the Aequinoctial. Then looke in your Inſtrument how many degrees of the Aequinoctial are intercepted betweene the Meridian, and the Arch repreſenting your Plaine: and reckoning the ſame num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of degrees vpon the Aequinoctial of the Dyal plaine, from the ſubſtile towards the ſide of Declination, there make a marke for the Meridian point thereof: in which
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:21526:80"/>
you muſt begin to diuide the Aequinoctial ſemicircle into houres both wayes: And that being diuided, apply a ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler to the center, and to euery one of the diuiſions: and at the points of the ſeuerall interſections of the ruler with the Aequinoctial interſection, draw the houre lines paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel to the ſubſtile. Set 12 at that houre line which was drawne at the interſection through the Meridian point of the Equinoctial: and 11, 10, 9, 8, &amp;c. on the Weſt ſide: and 1, 2, 3, 4, &amp;c, on the Eaſt ſide. Laſtly, hang the ſtile directly ouer the ſubſtile, and parallel to it, at the diſtance formerly taken.</p>
            <p>XXX Vſe. <hi>How by</hi> Sines and tangents <hi>to calculate the</hi> places of the Meridian, <hi>and</hi> Subſtile, <hi>and the</hi> height of the Stile <hi>aboue it: and the</hi> diſtance of the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian of the Aequinoctiall from the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile; <hi>together with the</hi> places of houre lines, <hi>both by calculation, and alſo Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trically.</hi>

            <p>I haue already taught the making of all manner of plaine Dyals moſt eaſily by the Inſtrument, for the ſame height of the Pole.

            </p>
            <p>And note that in South reclining, and North inclining Plaines, if <hi>Baſe II</hi> be leſſe then a quadrant, the contrary pole is eleuated aboue the Plaine: And if <hi>Baſe II</hi> be equall to a quadrant, the Plaine doth cut the Pole of the Aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall.</p>
            <p>Now concerning the placing of the ſubſtile vpon the Dyall plaine (as I haue already in the <hi>XXVIII Vſe</hi> ſhewed for the Meridian) Wee are to know, Firſt that the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile is to be drawne vpward from the line parallel to the horizon, if the Plaine be Northerne; or downeward from it, if it bee Southerne. Except in North reclining, and South inclining Dyalls, in which the <hi>Baſe I</hi> exceedeth the complement of inclination, and reclination: for in them it is quite contrary. And ſecondly that the ſubſtile is to be drawne in the contrary ſide from the Declination. But in North inclining, and South reclining Dyalls, in which the contrary Pole is eleuated, the ſubſtile muſt be drawne through the center into the oppoſite quadrant of your Dyall circle.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, the <hi>houre lines</hi> in all manner of plaine Dyalls, are thus to be found.</p>
            <p>If the ſubſtile and houre bee both on the ſame ſide of the Meridian: the arch of the Aequinoctiall betweene the ſubſtile, and the houre line, ſhall bee equall to the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the two diſtances, namely of the houre line from noone, and of the Meridian of the Aequinoctiall from the ſubſtile. But if the ſubſtile bee vpon one ſide of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:21526:82"/>
and the houre on the other ſide: it ſhall be equall to the ſumme thereof.

            </p>
            <p>Or elſe you may without calculation Geometrically inſcribe the houre lines in Dyals hauing centers (for how to doe it in Dyals not hauing centers, I haue already ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the <hi>XIX Vſe)</hi> thus.</p>
            <p>Deſcribe in your Dyall plaine a line for the ſtile, at the ſame height or diſtance from the ſubſtile, that the true ſtile ought to haue. Take alſo in the ſubſtile (as in reaſon you ſhall ſee fit) a point, and through it draw at right angles a long line, for the contingent, or Aequinoctiall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſection. Againe from the ſame point let fall a perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular vnto the ſtile: the length of this perpendicular is the neareſt diſtance betweene that point and the ſtile: and it is alſo the diſtance of the center of the Aequinoctiall from that point: meaſure it therefore vpon the ſubſtile, the contrary way from the center of the Dyall: and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing thus the center of the Aequinoctiall, deſcribe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon toward the contingent line one halfe of the Aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall circle: which if the ſubſtile be the Meridian, or 12 a clock line of your Dyall, you muſt begin to diuide in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to houres at the ſubſtile: But if the ſubſtile and Meridian of your Dyall be ſeuerall lines, apply a ruler to the center of the Aequinoctial, and to the interſection of the 12 a clock line with the contingent, and there draw a line: this line ſhal bee the Meridian of the Aequinoctial: at which you muſt begin to diuide the Aequinoctiall circle into houres, both wayes. Then applying a ruler vnto the center of the Aequinoctial &amp; euery one of thoſe diuiſions, where
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:21526:83" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the ruler in euery place ſhal cut the contingent line, there make a marke: and laſtly, through euery one of thoſe marks from the center of the Dyall, draw the houre lines themſelues.</p>
            <p>And if in any houre line it ſhall happen, that the ruler ſo applied will not reach to interſecat the contingent line: you may thus help your ſelfe. Which rule alſo may ſerue you to find the Meridian of the Aequinoctiall, as often as the interſection of the Meridian of the Dyall with the contingent, falleth without your paper or plaine.</p>
            <p>Draw the houre line as farre as it will goe.

Then applying a ruler to the point, which you tooke at all aduenture, and to the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſection of the parallel, which hath the diſtance of that center, whence the houre line giuen proceedeth, with that houre line: where the ruler ſhall cut the other pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel, make a prick: and meaſure the diſtance betweene that prick and the contingent, vpon the former parallel, on the other ſide of the contingent.
